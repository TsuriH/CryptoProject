        <p class="project-details">
         In this project I had to use several technologies in order to make everything work, like bootstrap, jquery, fetch and so like.
         <br />I have really enjoyed doing this project, particularly for the first time ever,  <br /> I built a whole api based project.
         Hope you enjoyed it,
